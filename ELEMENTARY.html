		<h1> MY ELEMENTARY DAYS </h1>
		<br><br><br>
	<p id="p1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I started my elementary life in Caloocan City, Manila. I studied there from kinder to grade 3 and then we moved to Surigao City becuase it is the place of my father. Together with my siblings, we transferred into the new school. My brother and I go to the same elementary school, while my eldest sister goes to high school.It was hard for us at first because we could not understand their langugae, but as the time goes by I made new friends. Back when I was in Manila, I am not a studious person, I just go to school because I am obliged to go to. but the moment i transferred into another school I was shock because I made it to the top 5 in the class and that is the moment when I realize that I should study more. I study but at the same time I bond with my classmates, I also had a crush when I was in grade 4 and the so called "puppy love" happened back then. When I was in 5th grade, I was a top student among the class and I cried after knowing it because that was may first time being a top 1. I have maintained my rank until 6th grade, it gaves me a little pressure becuase of the expectations of the people that surrounds me. </p><br>

	<p id="p1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My elementary days were memorable for me beacuse I made a lot of friends back then and up until now. I graduated as a salutatorian in 6th grade, I am so proud of my self that time and I know that it was just the beginning of my journey.
